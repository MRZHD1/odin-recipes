    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Popcorn chicken is a dish of bite-sized chunks of deep-fried chicken that are sure to be a family favorite. I love to serve the chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 cups oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour mixture again to coat.</li>
        <li>Lower pieces of chicken carefully into hot oil in batches; fry until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.</li>
    </ol>
